# Submission Summary

## 🛠 Project Overview

This voice-based AI assistant project was built using Node.js, WebSockets, and Google Gemini Pro API. It captures real-time voice inputs from users, transcribes them using Gemini, and responds intelligently — particularly tailored for Revolt Motors. The assistant can be repurposed easily for daily use or other brands.

## ⚙️ Approach & Tools Used

As someone experienced with AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, I leveraged prompt engineering to build the core logic quickly. Within **30 minutes**, the foundational structure was in place, and the complete project was ready in under **2 hours**. I used:
- **Gemini Pro API** for transcription and response generation
- **WebSocket** for real-time audio transmission
- **Node.js + Express** for the backend server
- **Ngrok** for local HTTPS tunneling
- **GitHub** for version control and deployment
- **ChatGPT** for documenting the project and bringing all parts together cohesively

## ⏱️ Time Spent

Approximately **5–6 hours** were spent on the entire project. I began work around 3 PM on the day I received the assignment and continued in focused sessions — 3–4 PM, 9–11 PM, and 1–2 AM. I began documentation the following morning.
- Setup and architecture planning
- Building and debugging
- Resolving Gemini API quota limits
- Preparing documentation and deployment

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Skills

I have a strong proficiency and background in working with AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity. I was among the first in my college to gain early access to ChatGPT when it was initially released by OpenAI, and I’ve been consistently using AI tools for over 3 years now.

This long-standing exposure has given me a deep understanding of how to effectively manipulate prompts and work with these systems to generate optimal results quickly. I know how to steer these tools strategically to maximize productivity within minimal time.
